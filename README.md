# iDioma Frontend README

# Project Summary:

iDioma is a study tool app designed to provide a place for users to store vocabulary words and notes while learning a foreign language. [app name] allows users to add vocabulary words and definitions to a Ruby on Rails backend and view all the words they have added on a React frontend. Additionally, there is a notes feature that allows users to create, edit, and delete notes on things such as grammar rules and pronunciation. 

# User Stories:

* As a user, I should be able to create an account. 
* As a user, I should be able to log in to my account. 
* As a user, I should be able to log out of my account. 
* As a user, I should be able to submit a word, definition, and where I encountered that word.
* As a user, I should be able to edit a wordâ€™s definition. 
* As a user, I should be able to delete a word and its associated data.
* As a user, I should be able to view all the words I submitted. 
* As a user, I should be able to enter notes in a notes section. 
* As a user, I should be able to edit or delete a note. 

# Stretch goals:

* As a user, I should be able to toggle to practice mode to hide the definitions of words. 
* As a user, I should be able to create separate sections for each language I am working on. 
* As a user, I should be able to create, edit, and view a checklist of practice goals.

# React App info below: 

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).

#### Next Steps:

* Add edit button and forms to vocab and notes. 
* Add ability to assign a category to words and add feature to make words and notes sortable by categories. 
* Add tabs for multiple languages to allow users to store notes and words for different languages.
* Add practice feature to vocab words (toggle to turn off definitiones, flashcard game, etc.).
* Add text editor to notes page to allow user to bold, italicize, highlight, color code, etc. the font for their notes. 
* Add customizable user profile tab. 
* Create tab for practice goals checklist. 
* Build out features for both human and programming languages.
